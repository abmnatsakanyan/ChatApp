# TASK
### Write a single view app in swift - a simple chat. 
The app should allow the user to enter some text (up to 300 symbols) and respond with a reversed string.
- Use UICollectionView (using diffable datasource and compositional layout would be a plus)
- Reversing a string should happen on a background thread (using structured concurrency will be a plus)
- Using viper would be a plus
